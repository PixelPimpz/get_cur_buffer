# tmux-nvim-info

### This plugin will be replaced with "tmux-metaphile" when I get the mechanics of this figured out. 

the idea of tmux-metaphile is to grab metadata about files open in (Neo)Vim for use in tmux, primarily the status bar. This plug-in is the part that grabs the file name of the currently open buffer in a pane/window running (Neo)Vim.

We shall see.
Now on with the show
